# CerealKillers

Hi there!

First off, thank you for taking interest in our guild posting! We are looking forward to hear from you soon.

# Introduction:
Greetings! My name is Colin, and I've been playing WoW since November 2006. As of now, I have 7~ years of GM experience, with my peak guild administration reaching 700 members. I tend to have a calm, collective attitude, and enjoy keeping a positive mentality.
# Guild History:
Cereal Killers was originally an established guild by a small group of friends in October 2011 on Kil’jaeden. During that time, we raided Cata-WoD together, transferred to Sargeras in patch 6.1, and ultimately put the guild to rest during Hellfire Citadel. Our peak progression was during patch 5.4, where we were able to get the “Cutting Edge” achievement for Siege of Orgrimmar (cleared heroic/mythic on patch).

With the announcement of classic, the old guild was able to band together and start anew on Herod. Just like before, we plan to reach the end-game content, and recreate a name for ourselves.

# About the Guild:
We’re a mature group of players that like to have a good laugh during our grinding sessions. We have a diverse group of individuals that primarily focus on benefiting the guild to the best of our ability. These benefits include, but aren’t limited to, helping with tough quests, getting dungeon groups together, and having intense world PvP skirmishes!

# Our Goals:
We plan to start running pre-raid BIS dungeons regularly by 9/23, along with our first MC run on 10/1. Once we transition to phase 2/3, we’ll continue to progress through MC/BWL/ONX, while also focusing on grinding PvP Gear/Titles outside of raid times. We plan to keep this track across the rest of the phases, up to clearing Nax. Likewise, if have interest in PVE, as well as like to let out your PVP side with an experienced group of players, this is the guild for you!

# Available Positions
Here’s a list positions/roles that we are currently looking for (High/Medium/Low Priority):

Hunter: High
Paladin (Nightfall/Sulfaras user): High
Rogue: High
Warlock: High
Druid (Healer): Medium
Druid (Tank): Medium
Mage: Medium
Warrior (Tank): Medium
Warrior (DPS): Medium
Druid (DPS): Low
Paladin (Healer): Low
Priest (Healer): Low

# Raid Times:
Tuesday/Thursday 6:30-10:30pm EST.
Note: This time is reserved for when we are deeper into phase 3/4, where we would have to clear multiple raids within a week. During phase 1/2, we should only need to use this much time for the first couple weeks of progression.

# Loot Rules:
Before full guild group: Free roll w/ maximum of 2 items per week.
After full guild group: +1; one “need” roll on an item per reset. Item’s will be linked for “need” rolls, then “greed” rolls. “need” rolls trumps “greed” rolls.

A scenario: The Boots of Might drops. John, Jared, Jake, and Jeff (Prot Warriors) have not used any of their rolls. They all decide to roll “need”. However, Jeff won the Gloves of Might previously from a “need” roll, so he cannot roll on the Boots.

John rolls: 50
Jared rolls: 85
Jake rolls: 99
Jeff rolls: Ineligible

Jake wins the item. Jake is no longer eligible for “need” rolls until Jared/John have won an item via “need”. Once John and Jared have won a “need” item, the “need” roll will reset, allowing everyone to be eligible to roll again.
